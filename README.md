## [Bin2Dec](https://krishguptadev.github.io/bin2dec) - A simple Binary to decimal Converter 🍒

### How to use 😕 ?

It's pretty simple Bin2Dec allows the user to enter a string of up to 8 binary digits (i.e. 0's and 1's), in any sequence and then displays decimal equivalent (or the other way around )
